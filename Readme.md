## Snake Game

The game itself works as it should(ish), it will work for awhile then crash also the fruit only spawns in the upper rows (no idea why).
The game requires no extra libs only that python3 is installed, dont know if versions older than 3.6 work though 3.4 up should be fine anything bellow might not. Just run main.py should appear same as cmd style window.

If anyone has any ideas on how to fix the 2 bugs i mentioned please let me know.
